** BUGS
*** TODO initial XY on entry, need to parameterize whether continuity is desired or not
**** alternative approach is to pull from current simulation nodes
**** generalization might be directionality per field
*** TODO display links is actually putting links into simulation and only filter links is doing filtering 
*** TODO exploding a package in "package graph" scene results in offscreen modules

** Updates
*** TODO update which changes only attributes
**** back and forth between color schemes
**** buttons to match
**** stretch goal: transitions, ie size of circle, fade on remove etc

*** add buttons to unpin
**** { all, modules, packages, tree, unused } sorts of filters

*** make vertical XY the default so that radial is only one transform

** Features
*** multiphase scenes
**** example: package graph
***** pin packages
***** run with fast cooling for a second or two
***** unpin packages
