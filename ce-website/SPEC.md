# Code Explorer V4 - Project Specification

## Vision

"Shock and awe" demo of the PSD3 library's capabilities, showcasing potential real use-cases for hybrid data-visualization/user-interface. The primary use-case is **at-a-glance understanding and exploration of a large codebase**.

## Design Principles

1. **Library showcase** - All visualization logic uses `psd3-selection` and `psd3-simulation` APIs. No custom JavaScript in the demo; if functionality is missing, add it to the library.

2. **Declarative scenes** - Explorable/manipulable scenes that transition from one to another via a declarative `SceneConfig` + `TransitionMatrix` system.

3. **Progressive disclosure** - Start with overview, drill down to detail. Each scene reveals more specific information.

4. **Data-agnostic architecture** - While we develop against our own codebase, the design should work with any codebase (PureScript, Haskell, etc.) via pluggable data adapters.

## Scenes

### Scene 1: Grid Overview

**Purpose**: Show package structure and relative sizes at a glance. Opening scene.

**Layout**:
- Packages arranged on a grid (fixed positions)
- Modules clustered around their parent package (ForceX/Y toward package)
- Circle sizes represent LOC (both packages and modules)
- Modules colored by parent package

**Interactions**:
- Hover: Highlight package and its modules
- Click package: Select for tree exploration
- Drag: Rearrange nodes

**Forces**:
- `forceXGrid`/`forceYGrid` - Modules toward parent package's grid position
- `forceCollideGrid` - Prevent overlap, reads radius from node

**Links**: None in Grid scene

### Scene 2: Dependency Tree

**Purpose**: Show the module dependency hierarchy rooted at a focal module (e.g., `Main`).

**Transition from Grid** (two phases):

*Phase 1: Package Orbit Formation*
1. Packages move from grid to radial ring (forceRadial)
2. Modules follow their parent packages
3. Selected package moves to center

*Phase 2: Tree Formation*
1. Staggered radial tree animation (layers appear in sequence)
2. Curved bezier links draw as nodes arrive
3. Pause to show tree structure
4. Links straighten, nodes unpin
5. Force simulation engages → organic tree layout

**Layout** (post-transition):
- Force-directed tree using D3's recipe:
  - `forceLink(distance: 0, strength: 1)` - Tight links
  - `forceManyBody(strength: -50)` - Gentle repulsion
  - `forceX(0)` + `forceY(0)` - Centering

**Links**: Rendered with actual source/target positions (varied, so fast)

**Interactions**:
- Hover: Highlight upstream (dependencies) and downstream (dependents)
- Click node: Filter to subgraph (upstream + downstream only)
- Drag: Standard force layout dragging

### Scene 3: Bubblepack Detail

**Purpose**: Show internal structure of modules - types, classes, instances, functions.

**Transition from Scene 2**:
- Clicked/selected nodes expand from circles to bubblepack containers
- Internal elements (colored circles) appear grouped by category

**Layout**:
- Each module is a containing circle (pack layout)
- Internal circles represent:
  - Type definitions (color A)
  - Foreign definitions (color B)
  - Type classes (color C)
  - Instances (color D)
  - Functions (color E)

**Interactions**:
- Hover internal circle: Show dependencies on this specific type/function
- Click internal circle: Filter to just its direct dependencies

## Data Model

### Current Phase (File-based)

Data generated by build scripts, served as static JSON:
- `modules.json` - Module metadata (name, package, LOC, etc.)
- `dependencies.json` - Module-to-module dependencies
- `internals.json` - Per-module type/function definitions

### Future Phase (Database-backed)

Query server for temporal data:
- Git history, commit timelines
- Issue correlations
- "Gource-style" animations
- Multi-codebase support

## Library Requirements

Forces needed from `psd3-simulation`:

| Force | Current Status | Needed |
|-------|----------------|--------|
| `forceManyBody` | ✅ Available | - |
| `forceManyBody` (filtered) | ✅ Available | `createManyBodyFiltered` in Core |
| `forceCollide` | ✅ Available (fixed radius) | - |
| `forceCollide` (dynamic) | ✅ Available | `createCollideDynamic` with `(node -> Number)` accessor |
| `forceLink` | ✅ Available | - |
| `forceCenter` | ✅ Available | - |
| `forceX` / `forceY` | ✅ Available (fixed target) | - |

Selection API needed from `psd3-selection`:
- General Update Pattern (GUP) - ✅ Available
- Transitions - ✅ Available (basic)
- Tick-driven transitions - ✅ Available via `PSD3.Transition.Tick` (recommended for simulations)
- Staggered transitions - ✅ Achievable via `startProgressFrom` with offset values

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation ✅
- [x] Set up ce-website subrepo
- [x] Add grid force variants to library (forceXGrid, forceYGrid, forceCollideGrid)
- [x] Create basic data loader (spago modules/packages JSON)
- [x] Implement Grid scene baseline (fast, 1003 nodes at 60fps)
- [x] Debug performance issues (overlapping lines = slow, varied positions = fast)

### Phase 2: Grid Scene Polish
- [ ] Add hover highlighting (package + modules)
- [ ] Add click selection for tree exploration
- [ ] Add drag interaction
- [ ] Scale node sizes by LOC

### Phase 3: Tree Scene
- [ ] Implement package orbit formation (transition phase 1)
- [ ] Implement tree formation (transition phase 2)
- [ ] Add links with proper source/target positions
- [ ] Add hover upstream/downstream highlighting

### Phase 4: Bubblepack
- [ ] Implement Scene 3 with pack layout
- [ ] Build transition from Scene 2 → 3
- [ ] Add internal element interactions

### Phase 5: Polish
- [ ] Refine animations and transitions
- [ ] Add keyboard navigation
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Documentation

## Performance Notes

**Key finding**: SVG line elements at identical positions cause severe browser rendering slowdown. Lines with varied positions render fast.

- Grid scene: No links (fast)
- Tree/Orbit scenes: Links have actual source/target positions (fast)
- Never render links at same/overlapping positions
