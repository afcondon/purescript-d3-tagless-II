# purescript-d3-tagless-II
Tagless final style interpreter / wrapper for D3 in PureScript, latest of many re-writes

Proper readme to come, see readmes for my repos with previous attempts for context

# state of this repo

400-ish lines of interpreter code and a  minimal example showing that this interpreter is capable of implementing 
the "General Update Pattern" (ie for transitions between data sets where entering, exiting and retained data are
all separately animated) 

# next steps

implement other key functionality tests, hierarchical data such as tree and simulation-controlled data such as
a force layout example.
